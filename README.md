# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection-Using-AI-and-Computer-Vision
Project Description:
This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging the MobileNetV2 architecture for efficient feature extraction. OpenCV is used for real-time face detection, and iMultis aids in dataset handling and augmentation. The system can classify whether a person is wearing a mask or no mask with high accuracy.

Key Features:
Dataset Handling & Preprocessing: Used iMultis for data augmentation and preprocessing to enhance the training dataset.

Deep Learning Model: Employed MobileNetV2, a lightweight yet powerful convolutional neural network, for efficient mask detection.

Real-Time Detection: Integrated OpenCV for live video stream processing and face detection.

TensorFlow & Keras: Used to train and fine-tune the classification model for accurate predictions.

High Accuracy: Achieved reliable performance in distinguishing between mask and no mask scenarios.



Workflow:
Data Collection: Gathered and labeled images of people wearing and not wearing masks.

Data Preprocessing: Applied image augmentation and resizing techniques for uniformity.

Model Training: Trained the model using MobileNetV2 with TensorFlow & Keras, optimizing with Adam and categorical cross-entropy loss.

Integration with OpenCV: Used OpenCVâ€™s face detection to identify and classify faces in real-time video streams.

Deployment: Implemented the trained model for real-time inference using a webcam or CCTV footage.



Applications:
Public Safety & Compliance: Can be used in public spaces to ensure mask compliance.

Smart Surveillance: Integrate with security cameras for automated monitoring.
